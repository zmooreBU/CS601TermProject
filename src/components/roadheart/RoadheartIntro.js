            <p >The <b>Roadheart Repository</b> is a crafting system for my Pathfinder 2e game. It is based on a modified version of <b><a href="https://battlezoo.com/products/battlezoo-bestiary-pdf" className="roadheart-external-link">BattleZoo's Monster Parts</a></b> system for D&D5e and Pathfinder 2e. I have made my own homebrew modifications to make it fit better with the world and intentions behind my game. In particular, Monster Parts system, as written, focuses much more on crafting permanent items, such as swords, armor, or magic items. I wanted a system that focused more on crafting consumable items, like potions and ammunition, but still allowed my players to harvest materials from their environment and the creatures they kill.</p>
            <p>
            If you are at all interested in a similar system for your own game, I highly recommend checking out and supporting BattleZoo's original work.</p>
